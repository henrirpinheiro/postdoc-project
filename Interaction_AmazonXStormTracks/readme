This directory contains analyses and data related to the investigation of the role of moisture originating from the Amazon in cyclogenesis processes at extratropical latitudes, particularly over southeastern South America. To assess this potential relationship, we analyzed two key variables associated with Amazonian moisture: atmospheric water vapor content and latent heat fluxes released during condensation processes. These components represent distinct aspects of Amazonian influence—while water vapor reflects moisture availability, latent heat fluxes capture the energy transferred to the atmosphere during cloud formation and precipitation. The variables correspond to monthly means over the domain 290°E–300°E / 12°S–2°N for the period 1980–2010.
