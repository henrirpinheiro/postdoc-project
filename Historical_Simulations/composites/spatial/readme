Spatial composites are generated using a system-centered approach following Bengtsson et al. (2007, 2009) and Catto et al. (2010). For extreme cyclones, the top 10% by maximum 850-hPa vorticity at T42 define the sample. Key atmospheric variables—vorticity, horizontal winds, MSLP, and precipitation—are interpolated onto a 30° × 30° grid with 0.5° resolution, centered on the cyclone’s vorticity maximum. The grid remains aligned with the Equator (unrotated) to preserve geographic context. Composites represent cyclones at peak intensity, capturing their most hazardous stage.
