1. Tracks were produced using vertically averaged vorticity between 850 hPa and 600 hPa, filtered to T63 resolution.

2. The intensity threshold was set to 0.5 × 10⁻⁵ s⁻¹, with a minimum system lifetime of 2 days; no distance filter was applied.

3. The eight additional fields include T63-filtered vorticity at 850, 700, 600, 500, and 250 hPa, as well as the maximum 925 hPa wind speed, maximum 10 m wind speed, and minimum mean sea level pressure (MSLP).

4. For the Southern Hemisphere, all track files cover the period from July of one year through June of the following year.

5 Not all models provide all simulation types.

6. The naming conventions for the scenarios are described at:
